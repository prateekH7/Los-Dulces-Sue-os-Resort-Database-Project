# 🌴 Los Dulces Sueños Resort Database System

This project presents a fully structured relational database system for **Los Dulces Sueños Resort**, developed using SQL (DDL + DML) and Python. It models real-world hotel operations including staff, guests, amenities, stays, services, and reservations — providing a hands-on experience in end-to-end database design, data population, and interaction.

## 🧱 Database Schema Overview

- **14+ normalized tables** with primary & foreign keys
- Realistic constraints using `CHECK`, `DATE`, `DECIMAL`, and `ENUM-like` logic
- Features hotel operations: managers, departments, rooms, amenities, guests, services, rentals, and reservations

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **MySQL** for schema, relationships, and queries  
- **Python (with MySQL Connector)** for database interaction  
- **Jupyter/VS Code** for script execution  
- **SQL DDL + DML** to manage schema and populate realistic records

---

## 🔍 Core Functionalities

- Manager and department assignments
- Guest room tracking and reservation history
- Amenity delivery and staff service records
- On-call staff schedules and rentals by date
- Complex joins and aggregation queries for reporting

## 🧠 What I Learned

> 💬 *"The most difficult part was writing accurate SQL queries and debugging schema relationships. But the most rewarding part was gaining hands-on experience in bridging theory with real-world scenarios — especially in simulating a hospitality management system from scratch."*

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Import `DDL Schema_db.sql` into MySQL to create the schema.
2. Run `DML data_file_db.sql` to populate all tables with sample data.
3. Use `Final Project.py` to connect via Python and perform queries.

---

## 🧑‍💼 Example Use Cases

- View which **staff delivered amenities** to a guest
- Track **on-call employees** by date range
- Calculate total **service cost per room**
- Find **top rented items** by guests per stay
